Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poll Manager consists of three components: a poll server, a LDC API
 layer and a poller.
 The Network Administrator will configure the poll server by giving it details
 of all of the LDCs and the set of network elements, OIDs and interval of
 the variables to be polled.
 When the server application is run, it reads all of the configuration variables
 and assigns network elements to LDCs automatically on the basis of the
 hopcount.
 This helps in reducing the amount of configuration work that the network
 administrator needs to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each LDC consists of two major components: the LDC API and the Poller.
 The LDC API handles computing the hopcount, and forwards all other requests
 to the Poller.
 The Poller and LDC API communicate using IPC (Inter-process communication),
 and the LDC API and Poll Server communicate over TCP by default.
 The communication is protocol-agnostic, and can be changed to Inproc, IPC,
 TCP, PGM or EPGM (encapsulated PGM, in which PGM packets are wrapped into
 UDP packets to make it more administrator-friendly).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poll Server periodically reads data from the LDCs and saves it to a
 database.
 The database defaults to in-memory SQLite3, but database access is abstracted
 away and in order to switch to a different database backend one only needs
 to install the appropriate database drivers.
 Drivers for PostgreSQL and MySQL are provided for the database abstraction
 library we used in addition to the SQLite3 drivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to saving values to a database, the Poll Server also provides
 a RESTful HTTP API to help simplify the implementation of some basic applicatio
ns that don't need to perform advanced queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Configuration, Communication and Serialization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All configuration is done using the YAML format.
 YAML is a straightforward machine parsable data serialization format designed
 for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.
 YAML was chosen over XML and JSON because it more easily read and written
 by humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For communication between the various components (with the exception of
 the HTTP API provided by the Poll Server), Consulo uses a messaging system,
 or "message-oriented middleware" called ZeroMQ.
 It is used in environments as diverse as financial services, game development,
 embedded systems, academic research and aerospace.
 ØMQ was originally conceived as an ultra-fast messaging system for stock
 trading and so the focus was on extreme optimization.
 Later on during the development, the focus shifted to providing a generic
 system for building distributed applications and supporting arbitrary messaging
 patterns, various transport mechanisms, arbitrary language bindings, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ZeroMQ is a messaging system, and doesn't provide serialization and unserializat
ion of data before and after transmission.
 For this purpose (across the application and even in the database) we use
 MessagePack, which is a binary-based efficient object serialization library
 that enables the exchange structured objects between many languages.
 All commands transmitted between the components are actually string arrays.
 The first (mandatory) element is the name of the command, and may be followed
 by parameters which are required for some of the commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Database access by the Polling Server is completely abstracted away by the
 Datastore class, which in turn uses 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rdbi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to connect to the server.
 A database table is used for the data collected each day, and this table
 is named in the format 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data_for_%Y_%m_%d
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each of these tables have the same schema: the columns are the UNIX timestamp,
 network element (IP address), OID and value.
 Before saving the value is serialized using MessagePack so that it can
 be unserialized to the original value after reading it from the database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default an in-memory SQLite3 database is used because this is the most
 convenient for development and testing.
 In a production environment this should be changed to MySQL or PostgreSQL,
 or atleast an SQLite3 database which is saved to a file.
 This is fairly straightforward to do and only involves changing the database
 driver being used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Design of the Components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poll Server primarily consists of two parts: the HTTP API and a worker.
 Internally the worker consists of 3 threads, two for regularly adding the
 tasks of reassigning NEs to LDCs and fetching values from the LDCs to a
 queue and one for actually executing the tasks.
 As it fetches the values from LDCs, the worker thread saves these to the
 Datastore.
 The HTTP API simply reads from the API.
 In order to add or remove LDCs or NEs/OIDs, a network administrator needs
 to edit the configuration file in the Poll Server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poll Server may send the following commands to an LDC:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PING
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] -- used for checking whether an LDC is up or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

HOPCOUNT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, IP] -- get the hopcount to the specified IP address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

TRACK
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, NE, OID, INTERVAL] -- start tracking the specified NE/OID using the given
 interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CLEAR_TRACKS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] -- stop tracking all previously assigned variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

TRACKED
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] -- return a list of tracked variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FETCH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] -- return all the new readings since the last time this command was sent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these commands, all but the first two are directly forwarded to the Poller
 by the LDC API.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poller and LDC API use the reactor pattern without the Synchronous Event
 Demultiplexer.
 The Poller creates a new 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tracked
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 object for each of the variables it tracks.
 Each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tracked
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 object is associated with a thread (This will create problems if there
 are a very large number of variables to be tracked.
 It would be wise to use a queue and worker threads-approach similar to
 the one used in the Poll Server.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poller uses a load sensitive polling algorithm which performs the poll
 at the next scheduled time if the server ever gets overloaded, causing
 the time taken to perform a poll to exceed the polling interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Adaptive Polling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single exponential smoothing based forecasting formula, known as EWMA
 (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average), has a basic recursive equation
 of the form,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{t+1}=\alpha y_{t}+(1-\alpha)S_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 is the next step estimate, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the running EWMA and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the latest reading.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The single exponential smoothing does not work well with datasets that exhibit
 trends.
 Hence, we consider EDS (Exponential Double Smoothing) which uses a second
 smoothing parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for dealing with linear trends, which must be chosen in conjunction with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{t+1}=\alpha y_{t+1}+(1-\alpha)(S_{t}+b_{t})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{t+1}=\beta(S_{t+1}-S_{t})+(1-\beta)b_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first equation adjusts the smoothed parameter from the trend 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the estimate of the previous period 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The next equation then updates the trend as the difference between the
 last two estimates.
 This form of EDS is Holt’s method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Holt's method assumes regular data sampling intervals and so, in order to
 perform adaptive sampling, we need to adopt a modification of EDS using
 Wright’s extension.
 However we found that in practice this is not necessary because Holt's
 method works well enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic algorithm used for adaptive sampling is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Read the next value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compare it with the forecasted value, if the difference is within a factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 increase the poll delay by a factor of 1.1, otherwise halve the poll delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Update the next forecast value using the value read in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wait for the amount of time specified by the new poll delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Go to step 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below are some graphs that depict simulations of adaptive polling using
 both EWMA and Holt's method for different types of data and different parameter
s.
 The red line is the true value of the function, the blue diamonds are the
 samples and the blue lines are the result of linear interpolation between
 the samples.

Sample Application: Real Time Grapher
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example of how to use the REST API provided by the Poll Server, we
 have included a simple sample application which graphs the values of the
 variables supplied in realtime.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application is written using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

 micro-framework, which is basically a DSL for quickly creating web applications
 in Ruby with minimal effort.
 The core logic is under 40 lines of code.
 The amount of code written for markup and styling is much larger than this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accessing the root webpage when the application is running will give a list
 of all of the network elements being tracked.
 Clicking on a network element will give a list of all of the OIDs tracked
 for that network element.
 Clicking on an OID will draw a real-time graph of that variable if it is
 a boolean or numeric quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For drawing the realtime graph without reloading the page we use AJAX (Asynchron
ous Javascript and XML) to transmit JSON (Javascript Object Notation) encoded
 objects to the browser from the server.
